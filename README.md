# Interactive Lissajous Curves

This project displays interactive Lissajous curves using the p5.js library.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Controls

*   **Frequency Sliders:** Adjust the sliders labeled "Freq A" and "Freq B" at the bottom-left to change the frequencies of the sine waves generating the curve.
*   **Pause/Resume:** Press the 'P' key to pause or resume the animation.
*   **Reset:** Press the 'R' key to reset the curve drawing.

The curve is generated by the parametric equations:
x = Amplitude * sin(frequencyA * time + phase)
y = Amplitude * cos(frequencyB * time)
